    "This exercise is primarily to assess your capabilities related to put all important DDL concepts in practice by coming up with solution for a typical data migration problem from one database (mysql) to another (postgres).\n",
    "* Here are the high level steps for database migration from one type of database to another type of database.\n",
    "  * Extract DDL Statements from source database (MySQL).\n",
    "  * Extract the data in the form of delimited files and ship them to target database.\n",
    "  * Refactor scripts as per target database (Postgres).\n",
    "  * Create tables in the target database.\n",
    "  * Execute pre-migration steps (disable constraints, drop indexes etc).\n",
    "  * Load the data using native utilities.\n",
    "  * Execute post-migration steps (enable constraints, create or rebuild indexes, reset sequences etc).\n",
    "  * Sanity checks with basic queries.\n",
    "  * Make sure all the impacted applications are validated thoroughly.\n",
    "* We have scripts and data set available in our GitHub repository. If you are using our environment the repository is already cloned under **/data/retail_db**.\n",
    "* It have scripts to create tables with primary keys. Those scripts are generated from MySQL tables and refactored for Postgres.\n",
    "  * Script to create tables: **create_db_tables_pg.sql**\n",
    "  * Load data into tables: **load_db_tables_pg.sql**\n",
    "* Here are the steps you need to perform to take care of this exercise.\n",
    "  * Create tables\n",
    "  * Load data\n",
    "  * All the tables have surrogate primary keys. Here are the details.\n",

    "    * departments.department_id\n",
    "  * Get the maximum value from all surrogate primary key fields.\n",
    "  * Create sequences for all surrogate primary key fields using maximum value. Make sure to use standard naming conventions for sequences.\n",
    "  * Ensure sequences are mapped to the surrogate primary key fields.\n",
    "  * Create foreign key constraints based up on this information.\n",
    "    * orders.order_customer_id to customers.customer_id\n",
    "    * order_items.order_item_order_id to orders.order_id\n",

    "    * categories.category_department_id to departments.department_id\n",
    "  * Insert few records in `departments` to ensure that sequence generated numbers are used for `department_id`.\n",
    "* Here are the commands to launch `psql` and run scripts to create tables as well as load data into tables.\n",
